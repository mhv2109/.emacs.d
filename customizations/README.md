## Customizations

Customization files alter the default behavior of Emacs, typically on a per-language basis, by listeneing to built-in language 
hooks.

Customizations have to be loaded in [init.el](../master/init.el), under the [Customization](../master/init.el#L133) section, e.g. `(load setup-python.el)`.
